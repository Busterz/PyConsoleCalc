# PyConsoleCalc

This project is initially created for fun and with some additional binary conversions to help myself without going online.

## What is this about?

It is a calculator created in Python. There are also additional features than just basic calculation including English to Binary conversion, Decimal to Binary conversion, and vice versa.

## How to run it?

Currently there is no installer, so you have to download the `Py Files` directory and all the python files in it.

1. Run your command prompt.
2. Navigate to your `Py Files` directory.
3. Run the main file on your command prompt by typing `python PyConsoleCalc.py`.
4. Congratulations! The script has run!

:information_source: The above instruction is with the assumption that you have python installed beforehand.

## Development

I consider this project to be still under development. I might add new features and turn it into an installer.
